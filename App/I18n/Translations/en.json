  "faq1_description": "The app inSpiaggia helps you to avoid crowded beaches in Puglia, letting you choose a location according to your needs, thanks to the collaboration of the affiliated municipalities. Each municipality has staff on the beaches that will report the status of the beaches! \n You will finally have the opportunity to enjoy the relax and peace of the seaside without having to rush to occupy the last free spot.",
  "faq2_title": "WHAT YOU CAN DO",
  "faq2_description": "The app allows you to check the status of the free beach you have chosen, but also to explore places you don't know! Each beach has its own information sheet with its main features, with weather forecasts and much more. Once you have selected your destination, you will be able to start navigating to the location and share this beach with your friends.",
  "faq3_title": "WHAT ELSE YOU CAN DO",
  "faq3_description": "The app provides information on the maximum capacity of the beaches. Considering this data, you can also report any overcrowding, which will be checked by an operator on site. \n You can choose in peace and with awareness where you can spend your day on the seaside, displaying the status of the beach whenever you want. \n The app will also inform you about local events nearby, ensuring a complete experience in the area, moreover, you can save your favourite destinations.",
  "faq4_title": "WHAT ARE THE AFFILIATED MUNICIPALITIES",
  "faq4_description": "The app was born from a pilot project involving the following coastal municipalities:\n Mola di Bari, Polignano a Mare, Monopoli, Ostuni, Carovigno, Maruggio, Ginosa, Pulsano (the list of municipalities grows every day) and with the patronage of the Puglia Promotion Regional Tourism Agency.\n\n These virtuous municipalities, with their volunteers, will report to you the crowded conditions of the beaches, offering a complete and integrated service also with local info and events. So you no longer have to search the web for communications and information that are often difficult to find!",
